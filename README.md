## Why ATS Systems Reject You
Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) parse resumes into structured data. If you use:
* ❌ Complex columns
* ❌ Graphics/Icons
* ❌ Headers/Footers for contact info

...the bot can't read your skills.

**The Fix:** Use linear, text-based layouts. 
> 💡 **Check your score:** Run your current resume through our **[Free ATS Resume Checker](https://www.woberry.com/resume-builder)** to see exactly what the bots see.

## AI Prompts for Cover Letters
If you are using ChatGPT to write cover letters, use this system prompt to stop it from sounding robotic.

**The Prompt:**
```text
Act as a professional career coach. I am applying for the role of [Job Title] at [Company].
Here is my resume: [Paste Resume]
Here is the job description: [Paste JD]

Write a cover letter that:
1. Connects my specific experience in [Skill 1] to their requirement for [Requirement 1].
2. Adopts a tone that is professional but enthusiastic.
3. Keeps it under 250 words.
